Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Since you already here, I will introduce myself.

I am Tony, a web developer from Indonesia. I have been a professional web developer since 2012.

I work for digital agencies for almost 4 years. Since that time, I have built [many kinds of websites](/works), and I focused more on WordPress. WordPress theme, plugin, maintenance, anything related to WordPress, you name it.

Right now I am working for [PeepSo](https://peepso.com), a social network plugin for WordPress that allows you to quickly and effortlessly add a social network or an online community, similar to Facebook right inside your WordPress site.

Besides WordPress (PHP), I also speak JS, especially Vue. But I think still not ready for production yet.
